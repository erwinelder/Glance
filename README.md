Make records of your expenses and income and view statistics on that.

• Multiple Records
Make a record of an expense or income by specifying the record category, amount, note, and quantity of what you have bought. You can include multiple items in one record because when you buy something, it may not necessarily belong to just one category.

• Transfers
Make transfers from one of your accounts to another within the app at different rates. If you have one account in the local currency of the country where you live and another account for savings in another currency, you can easily make a record of the transfer between these two accounts by specifying the rate.

• Accounts
Set up accounts by specifying the balance, currency, color, whether you do not want to show the account balance, or whether you do not want to show the account in the app top bar. Or maybe it is an account without a balance at all.

• Record Categories
Set up your own categories. Adjust the category name, color, and icon to specify exactly what records this category is for. Or just continue with the default ones.

• Statistics
View your recent records on the app home screen or go to a separate screen to view all of your records. View statistics by categories and subcategories to see how much you have spent on items within different categories. Easily filter categories by your collections. View these statistics by specifying the period: this month, last month, a specific month of a specific year, or a completely custom period.

• Budgets
Create budgets for a specific period and a category and choose which accounts to link them with. When creating a record, choose whether to include it in the budgets. View statistics for your budgets all at once or view detailed data by past periods for each budget separately.

• Personalization
Choose which widgets to display and in what order on the app's home screen. Reorder navigation buttons in the app's bottom bar to match your preferences. Select static light or dark theme, or turn on automatic theme switching depending on your system.
